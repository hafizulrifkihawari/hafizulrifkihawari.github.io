            <h4> About Me </h4>
            <p>
                There is not much about me, I was born in Banda Aceh, which is in the northest edge of Indonesia.
                Currently im in my early 20s, let's just say that I'm mature enough to be around :). 
            </p>
            <p>
                The first time you saw me, you might think that I'm a bit unapproachable. But, that's
                not always the case. I could come up a little bit awkward to be around and not that good at
                making a small talk. So yeah, that's just how i am, just kinda shy at the very few encounter.
                That doesn't mean i don't want to interact with you though, i loved some good discussion about every
                little things there is. When you get to know me deeply, that's when my true self comes out. A chill guy 
                with the same worry as other people, filled with sarcasm and bad dad jokes, just kidding :). I do feel 
                a great attachment to those that are close to me that I would make sure to do everything to help and support them.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the time I'm writing this, i'm trying to take a great leap of a change for myself.
                Both in career choice and the environment I'm surrounded by. So far, I would say it's 
                going great, I got to meet a whole range of new people with vastly varied background.
                Got to learn all kind of stuff everyday, tackling new problem that i've not encountered ever, and do my 
                best to actually solve it. I aspire to be better than yesterday every passing day of my life. With all of this 
                going on my life right now, I just hope the future me would be proud of my decision today.

            <p>
                Past few months, I've been learning and working several topics that interest me. At the end of the weeks,
                I decided to join Hacktiv and pursue my interest to be a Developer. What things interest me the most? I would 
                say all the logic behind computer and making computer do as we wish using the skill that i learned felt really great.
                Things that i learned such as:

                    <p>
                        This is not the first time i encountered HTML, despite my background not in IT.
                        I used html few times in the past, really long time ago though, so I would say that 
                        I started from zero again. Still, there's a familiarity with working using HTML, probably
                        because it's not that complex to understand.
                    </p>

                        Not that different from HTML. CSS and HTML goes hand to hand together to achieve a styled 
                        content that are easier to read, and access. Basically to beautify the website to put it simply.
                        For me, learning CSS is not necessarily hard. Truth is, I'm just not as good doing a design. My 
                        impression of learning CSS past few days is, it's a tedious process to do and I gotta say I 
                        need to work on my design perspective and creativity to see what's a good design and what's not.

                        Learning Javascript from the scratch is hard. I've learned Python before, from my own experience
                        I would say JS is harder to understand and get around. Fundamentally, the logic behind it is not that 
                        different across the language, but getting familiar with the syntax took some time. Currently, I tried 
                        my best to solve logic challenges everyday. Got to say though, solving the problem by your own gives that 
                        much satisfaction to yourself. I'll still try to learn more and more everyday so I can create something 
                        amazing with my own skill.
